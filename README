Traditional Mongolian script or Uyghur-Mongol script is used to write the
Mongolian language originally, and in current use especially in Inner
Mongolia. Although it is included in Unicode, it is still difficult to render
correctly. The first difficulty is that the Mongolian script is written
vertically, and unlike Chinese or Japanese, the left line comes first. Another
difficulty is that Mongolian letters have initial, medial, final and isolate
forms. Ligature handling is also required.

This is a Graphite-enabled version of traditional Mongolian fonts originally
available from mongolfont.com. The OpenType fonts from mongolfont.com work
well on Windows 7, but unfortunately not on Linux. Adding Graphite tables is
one solution which gives the capability of intelligent contextual glyph/
ligature handling for the various scripts.
